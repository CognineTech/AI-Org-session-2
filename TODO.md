# TODO: Road to Deep Learning Slide Redesign

## Steps

- [x] Read and understand current slide structure
- [x] Create plan and get user approval
- [x] Implement redesigned slide with:
  - [x] Remove all bullet points and code block (reduce text)
  - [x] Add Phase 1 canvas animation: rule flowchart (email → rules → blocked)
  - [x] Add Phase 2 canvas animation: scatter plot + decision boundary + accuracy meter
  - [x] Add Phase 3 canvas animation: neural network forward pass with signal particles
  - [x] Enhanced flowing particle arrows between phases
  - [x] Auto-sequence spotlight (cards glow one by one every 4s)
  - [x] Click-to-replay on each card
  - [x] Shorter key question bar
- [x] Files complete: deep-learning-slide-00a-road-to-dl.html + road-to-dl-anim.js
