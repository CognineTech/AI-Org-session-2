# TODO: Road to Deep Learning Slide Redesign

## Steps

- [x] Read and understand current slide structure
- [x] Create plan and get user approval
- [x] Implement redesigned slide with:
  - [x] Remove all bullet points and code block (reduce text)
  - [x] Add Phase 1 canvas animation: rule flowchart (email → rules → BLOCKED)
  - [x] Add Phase 2 canvas animation: SPAM/SAFE cards pop in → ML brain pulsing with orbiting dots → scanning beam → SPAM DETECTED! → 94% Accurate!
  - [x] Add Phase 3 canvas animation: neural network forward pass with glowing nodes
  - [x] Enhanced flowing particle arrows between phases
  - [x] Auto-sequence spotlight (cards glow one by one every 4s)
  - [x] Click-to-replay on each card
  - [x] Shorter key question bar
- [x] road-to-dl-anim.js written via Python script (13,839 chars, all functions verified)
